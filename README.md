tidytabs
========

I like to keep about 10 different windows opened, each roughly corresponding to a specific topic. Sometimes I will be browsing in the window of topic A and I want to open a link that creates a new tab in the window of topic B.

tidytabs adds a contextual menu to any link, for you to choose which of the existing windows should be used to create the new tab.

That's it.
