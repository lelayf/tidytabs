## The problem

Like a buck carrying its woods, I like to keep about 10 different windows opened, each roughly corresponding to a specific topic. For instance I might keep a window for personal email and social networks, one fr professional email, calendar and slack, one for MOOCs, one for art stuff, one for web frameworks (I'm learning Lift) and one focusing on a specific area of Machine Learning. The thing is that sometimes I am browsing in "topic A" window and find a link relevant to "topic B" window. By default Chrome will allow me to open the link in a new tab in the same window or in a new window. Which kinda sucks. What I wantIreally is to open that link in a new tab in "topic B" window.

## The solution

tidytabs adds a contextual menu to any link, for you to choose which of the existing windows should be used to create the new tab.

Each window is identified by the title of its first tab, or the title of the window itself if it has no tabs. It's up to you to use a first tab that properly reflects the topic of the window and try to keep those first tabs active when you switch between windows.

Not ideal, but kinda usable. That's it.

## Install
 
Drag and drop tidytabs.crx on your extensions page in Chrome (Options > Tools > Extensions).
